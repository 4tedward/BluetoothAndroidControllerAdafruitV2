# BluetoothAndroidControllerAdafruitV2

This project is an android app that sends messages to a bluetooth HC-06 module. I used this app along with another one of my repositories--an arduino sketch, ArduinoAndroid, to control four bidirectional motors connected to an Adafruit motor V2 motor shield. To set up the app, simply change the address in MainActivity to the address of your HC-06 module.
